### **About Me: Bridging Data, Biology, and Personalized Health**  

As a nutrition teacher and data analyst, I am passionate about redefining health management through data-driven insights and technological innovation. My journey began with two contrasting experiences: Warren Buffett, who thrives on hamburgers and cola at 94, and my grandfather, who lived by strict health principles yet succumbed to multiple myeloma. These experiences taught me that health is not dictated by universal rules but shaped by individual biological factors.  

For six years, I worked as a nutrition educator, guiding 900 elementary students toward healthier habits. However, I realized that a single teacher cannot track each student’s health individually. This led me to explore **data analytics and IT solutions** to optimize health management. I pursued a second major in data science, delving into statistics, R, SQL, and Python, to digitize and personalize nutrition education. From analyzing school meal data to designing automated food allergy alerts, I saw how **technology transforms health monitoring and intervention**.  

Yet, despite behavioral data, the missing piece remained: **biological individuality** at the cellular and genetic levels. How do metabolic variations and genetic predispositions shape health outcomes? I believe bioinformatics holds the key to **customizing health strategies** based on molecular insights.  

Now, I am on a journey to integrate **nutrition, data science, and bioinformatics** to develop personalized, scientifically grounded health solutions. By leveraging **biological data, AI, and digital tools**, I aspire to build a future where health management is **not about following rigid rules, but about understanding and optimizing one’s unique biological blueprint**.
