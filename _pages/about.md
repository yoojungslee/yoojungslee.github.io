### **About Me Bridging Data, Biology, and Personalized Health**  
“Warren Buffett eats  hamburgers and soda every day. However, he remains in good health at the age of ninety-four.” :hamburger:  	

Inspired by Warren Buffett’s unconventional diet thriving at 94, I’ve learned health varies individually. After six years educating 900 students, I embraced data science (R, SQL, Python) to enhance nutrition education.  

Now, I explore bioinformatics to decode metabolic and genetic influences on health.  

#### :running_woman: My goal 
- Redefining health management by optimizing each person’s unique biological blueprint.
- Integrate nutrition, data, and biology to craft tailored health solutions using AI and digital tools.
