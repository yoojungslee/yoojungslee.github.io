### **About Me: Bridging Data, Biology, and Personalized Health**  

Inspired by Warren Buffett’s unconventional diet thriving at 94, I’ve learned health varies individually. After six years educating 900 students, I embraced data science (R, SQL, Python) to enhance nutrition education. Now, I explore bioinformatics to decode metabolic and genetic influences on health. My goal: integrate nutrition, data, and biology to craft tailored health solutions using AI and digital tools, redefining health management by optimizing each person’s unique biological blueprint.
