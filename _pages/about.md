### **[About Me] Bridging Data, Biology, and Personalized Health**  
“Warren Buffett eats  hamburgers and soda every day.  :hamburger:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, he remains in good health at the age of 94.” 	

Inspired by Warren Buffett’s unconventional diet, I’ve learned health varies individually. Through six years educating 900 sstudents, I embraced data science (R, SQL, Python) to enhance nutrition education.  

Now, I explore bioinformatics to decode metabolic and genetic influences on health.  

### :running_woman: **My goal** 
- Changing the paradigm of health management by optimizing each person’s unique biological blueprint.
- Integrating nutrition, data, and biology to craft tailored health solutions using AI and digital tools.
