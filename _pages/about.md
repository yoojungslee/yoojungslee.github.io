### **[About Me] Bridging Data, Biology, and Personalized Health**  
‚ÄúWarren Buffett eats  hamburgers and soda every day.  :hamburger:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, he remains in good health at the age of 94.‚Äù 	

Through six years educating 900 sstudents, I‚Äôve learned health varies individually.  
I embraced data science (R, SQL, Python) to enhance nutrition education.  

Now, I hope to explore biodata to decode metabolic & genetic influences on health.
